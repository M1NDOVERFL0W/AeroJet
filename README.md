**Aero Jet** - Java AOT Compiler (WIP)

### A bit of history
In year 2019 the Java World has fall into darkness because 
[Excelsior JET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excelsior_JET) project has gone 
into nowhere.
Java Community loosed possibility to build native applications from Java code.

Since these days I'm thinking about resurrecting of native 
[AOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation) 
compilation of Java byte  code

### What is done already
TBD
